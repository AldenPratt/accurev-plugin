    This configures the way the snapshot is named, allowing the use of environment variables using the same syntax as Ant uses for property expansion.<br/>
    i.e. a literal <tt>$</tt> must be escaped as <tt>$$</tt>, and <tt>${</tt><i>name</i><tt>}</tt> resolves to the value of environment variable "<i>name</i>".<br/>
    If not set, the snapshot name defaults to "<i>job_name</i>_<i>build_number</i>".
    </p>
    <p>
    The default is "<tt>${JOB_NAME}_${BUILD_NUMBER}</tt>".
    It can be set to any combination of literal text and environment variables,
    subject to AccuRev's snapshot naming restrictions:
    "<i>The name must begin with a non-digit other than dot (.), and must not include either a slash (/) or a backslash (\)</i>".<br/>
    e.g. "<tt>${ACCUREV_STREAM}_${BUILD_NUMBER}_Snapshot</tt>"
    would take the name of the stream being built,
    append an underscore,
    append the build number
    and finally append "_Snapshot",
    which would result in a snapshot name of the form
    "<tt>MyStreamName_1234_Snapshot</tt>".
