    	If set, this sets the naming schema used for the snapshot.<br/>
    	If not set, the snapshot name defaults to "<i>job_name</i>"_"<i>build_number</i>".
    </p>
    <p>
    This allows the use of environment variables, using the same syntax as Ant.
    The default is "<pre>${JOB_NAME}_${BUILD_NUMBER}</pre>", i.e. "<i>job_name</i>"_"<i>build_number</i>",
    but can be set to any combination of literal text and environment variables
    (subject to AccuRev's snapshot naming restrictions
    "The name must begin with a non-digit other than dot (.), and must not include either a slash (/) or a backslash (\)."
    ).
    </p>
    <p>
    e.g. "<pre>${ACCUREV_STREAM}_${BUILD_NUMBER}_Snapshot</pre>"
	would name the snapshot by taking the name of the stream being built and
	appending the build number and "_Snapshot" to form e.g.
	"MyStreamName_1234_Snapshot".
