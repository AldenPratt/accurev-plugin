    <p>
    	If checked, the plugin will add the '-n' flag to the 'accurev login'
    	command when logging in.
    	<br /><br />
    	This flag will (depending on server configuration) request a login session that will not expire after an arbitrary time period (default of 240 minutes) has elapsed.
    	This is rarely an issue when using "traditional" authentication, but can be useful when using "accurev_login" or "custom" authentication on the server.
